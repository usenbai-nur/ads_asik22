Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement custom data structures to gain a deeper understanding of how fundamental data structures work and how they can be efficiently implemented from scratch. This project focuses on implementing five core data structures: MyArrayList, MyLinkedList, MyStack, MyQueue, and MyMinHeap. These data structures will be built without relying on Java's built-in java.util classes, except for the Iterator interface.

The custom implementations will be designed to behave similarly to their standard counterparts, ensuring proper functionality and performance. The project also emphasizes the importance of a clean, consistent API, which is why a shared MyList interface is implemented across the list-based data structures. This approach will help facilitate code reuse, promote consistency, and make it easier to understand the relationships between the different structures.

Data Structures Implemented
MyArrayList: A dynamic array implementation that allows for efficient resizing and provides basic list operations like adding, removing, and retrieving elements.

MyLinkedList: A linked list implementation that allows for constant-time insertions and deletions at both ends, providing basic operations like insertion, removal, and traversal of elements.

MyStack: A stack implementation based on MyLinkedList that supports Last In, First Out (LIFO) operations, including pushing, popping, and peeking at the top element.

MyQueue: A queue implementation based on MyLinkedList that supports First In, First Out (FIFO) operations, allowing for enqueueing, dequeueing, and peeking at the front element.

MyMinHeap: A custom binary heap implementation specifically designed as a min-heap, providing efficient access to the smallest element while supporting insertion and removal operations.

Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

Develop a solid understanding of common data structures and how they can be implemented from scratch.

Reinforce key programming concepts, including object-oriented design, data structure algorithms, and memory management.

Promote best practices in software development, including documentation, version control (via Git), and clear, consistent coding standards.
